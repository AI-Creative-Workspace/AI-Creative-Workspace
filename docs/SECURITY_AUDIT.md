## Security Overview

AI Creative Workspace ensures security through the following measures:

1. **Smart Contract Audits:**  
   - Regular third-party audits of all deployed smart contracts.  
   - Formal verification of critical contract logic to prevent vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks and overflows.  
   - Audit firms include: CertiK, Quantstamp, and OpenZeppelin.

2. **Data Encryption:**  
   - End-to-end encryption of user data using AES-256 and TLS 1.3.  
   - Blockchain-based content verification to ensure integrity.  

3. **Authentication & Authorization:**  
   - OAuth 2.0-based secure login mechanisms.  
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all admin-level accounts.  
   - Role-based access controls (RBAC) to restrict unauthorized actions.  

4. **Penetration Testing:**  
   - Regular penetration tests conducted on frontend and backend systems.  
   - White-hat hacker programs and bug bounty initiatives.
